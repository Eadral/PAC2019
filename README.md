> Notices:
> 1) Residual threshold is adjusted so that double-precision floating-point might 
> be necessary for convergence.
> 2) MPI rank number is adjusted to 24 so that no core is oversubscribed on HSW/
>  BDW/SKL/CLX processor.
> 3) The result should be reproducible. Please submit all changes, including codes, 
> building and running scripts.
> 4) Can't modified the file: pcg.90 , solver_pcg_mod.f90 , time_management.f90, pop_in
> 4) Algorithm optimization is strongly encouraged. Some references on Communication-
> avoiding Krylov subspace methods are given below, as well as the P-CSI (Chebyshev 
> Iteration) paper.
> Some infrastructural functions (hints) are already provided, such as create_boundary_capcg 
> and update_matpow_halo for thicker boundary update in CA-PCG solver, global_sum_1d_dbl 
> for one-dimensional double array, etc.
